TODAY CLASS : OPERATORS 
===========================

Types:
1. Assignment (= ,+=,,-= ) 

2. Arthmetic (+ - * / // % **)
	// - integer result(integer quotient)
	%  - remainder of num1/num2 

3. Comparison (> >= < <= == !=) --> True | False 

4. Identity and Membership 
	is is not  --> compare address 
	in not in ---> check memership 
	
5. Logical 

6. Bitwise 
- operator is a symbol which applies on operands(variables/values)
- applying operator on operands to do operation
		ex: 10+20
			
			
			
##OBSERVATION
	##MODULUS OPERATOR
	
		1. Numerator<Demo ---> Answer is Numerator
		2. Numerator == Demo --> 0
		3. Numerator> Demo (get remainder doing division method)
		4. Demo == 0 --> Raise Error
		
	1. = is used for assignment 
	ex: varName = value 

	2. == is used for content/value comparision 
	ex: 10 ==12
	
	3. is operator is used for memory address comparion
