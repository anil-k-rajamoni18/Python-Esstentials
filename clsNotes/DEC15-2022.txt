###LAST CLASS
	- Py2 vs Py3 
	- Python Identation (whitespace )
	=> print() 
		- value
		- sep = ' '
		- end = '\n'
		- file = sys.stdout ---> screen/mointor/console
		-flush = False
		
	


##TODAY CLASS 
======================
- remaing print() 

## COMMENTS 
	=> single comment # 
	==> multiline comments ''' ''' or """ """
	
### variables 
	- a name assigned to memory location , to store the data and fetch whenever we call it.
	- WHY WE NEED ?
		- instead of calling with memory address it's easy to call with meaningful names.
	- Variables posses variablity property : which change it's variable during programming execution.
	
	



###OBSERVATIONS:
	- Very function in Python by default they have to return some value , 
	#if they don't return any values, interpreter will return None value.
	- print() method by default it will not return any value , so interpreter will return NONE by default.
	##Two case:
		- when storing function calling in one variables , expects return value 
		- when calling one function inside another function , expects return value.
		
		
	==> Java , C , C++ --> static lang's , we have to declare the data types
	==> Python --> dynamic is lang , no need to declare the data type 
			-- interperter will decide the data type based on the value in RUNTIME.
